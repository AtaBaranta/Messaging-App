# Messaging-App

It is a messaging application written in C language in a <ins>**very tight time**</ins> for the Operating Systems course project in the Computer Science Undergraduate Degree.

It is designed as multithreaded, using socket programming, with a single server and N-Client.

This console application also stores all users and messages in a defined 'users' and 'messages' file. That gives us the opportunity to retrieve all data even after the server has shut down.

<br/>

>NOTE: Run the clients with a Command Line Argument 'id', which is an integer value.
